# Data-Science-Portfolio-Projects

Hi there! Thanks a lot for viewing this page. Here, I have summarized my skills and datascience projects that show my credibity

### OOP's Concepts (Python)
This is python project where I have used OOP's and exception handling concepts in python. The inspiration of script is taken from biology
where you have to provide a DNA sequence, and program will tell whether the sequence has sites for common restiction enzymes. Restriction enzymes are proteins that cut the DNA at a specific site (a specifc group of string of bases). So, it can be useful for biologist who want to carry out expriments to check which enzyme would suit better for their study. <br />

### SQL and Data Story-telling
In this project, I demonstrate ways to connect your MySQL database with python. Further, have tried to tell and describe a story using 
the 'Canada Vechile Dataset (2000-2022)' taken from Kaggle. The dataset has information about, model of cars, their engine size, 
number of cylinders and highway mileage about cars released on road from 2000 to 2022. <br />
